# SCRUM meeting minutes for {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}

## Peter

### What did I do last week?
* TPM recruitment
    * Four applications received so far from cpjobs.com
    * Still trying to get advert onto jobsdb.com - need to business registration 
      certificate from BGI so have to go through HR
* Dev
    * Created [PR](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/563) to 
      fix issue [#562](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/562)
      error re: setup_devdb.sh cannot find module 'fs-path' problem
    * WL submission wizard
        * Currently working on fixing [dataset image functionality](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/534)
          Asked Chris what he wants to see when clicking Save button on github 
          issue
* Helped Ken with his work
    * DINT project
        * Looked at Nicole's [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KDI6qOHzWnT4a8LY8Jh1_uoXadFJYC01/view) 
          and screenshots to determine workflow for creating content to append 
          text by copy and paste.
        * Created [diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YKiT9h8Txsjkb-6fWlJzCEcnms9ElApE/view?usp=sharing) 
          to summarise workflow for how the text for content to append is made
        * Asked Chris H to pull out the reviews for a list of GigaScience papers from EM into an Excel spreadsheet
    * https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/503 add delete feature 
      in adminFile page
        * Getting Error 500 trying to get property of non-object when deleting 
          MD5 checksum attribute for File [17679](http://gigadb.gigasciencejournal.com:9170/adminFile/update/id/17679)
        * Problem originates in AdminFileController line 422 - the 
          `$_POST['File']['sample_name']` returns a sample id so it should be 
          using `findByPk()` not `findByAttributes()` to return a sample object.
        * Also, the tests do not check that file attributes deletion has been 
          committed into the database after clicking Save button.
    * https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/521 retrieve citation 
      detail in text in dataset page
        * Drop down menu box positioning
        * How should menu box be implemented?
        * Reading:
            * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5209814/can-i-position-an-element-fixed-relative-to-parent
            * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11151089/position-one-element-relative-to-another-in-css
            * Add into pattern library

## Rija

### What did I do last week?
* Technical project manager recruitment
    * There is an [agile HK meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Agile-Hong-Kong/) 
      - could use this to help us find a TPM 
      who can do SCRUM
    * Talked to UK friends running an agile company - he said he may have people 
      but they won't be available full time
* SCRUM reading
* Dev work
    * FTP issues exampling our plan
    * Contributed to web statistics email discussion - Nginx web server access 
      logs can provide us with this information
    * DOI minting project - missed screenshots from Nicole
    * Worked on end to end workflow for FUW - found lots of issues, e.g. 
      certificate used to deploy GigaDB. Problem is Gitlab CI/CD generates a new 
      certificate every time and can reach limit for the number of certificates 
      that can be created. We need to preserve certificates. Also fixed other 
      issues
    * Reviewer mockup description not showing
    * Created a video recording but not great.

### What will I do this week?
* Fix problem with review mockup and do rebase with develop branch
* Plan workshop scrum event

### Are there any problems in the way?
* None expected.

## Ken

### What did I do last week?
* Mint DOI project - gathered information from Nicole. Updated [Azure prototype](https://5m1bfb.axshare.com/#id=m363d5&p=main_page)
* Retrieve citation detail issue - https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/521
    * Solved how to get consistent view in different browsers
    * Updated behat test
    * Working on problem with drop down menu box moving around when varying 
      screen size - need make sure fix works on Firefox too and Internet 
      Explorer
* Add delete button for file attribute - https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/503
    * Sample attribute problem causing error messages
    * Save button doesn't actually delete file attribute, just doesn't display 
      file attribute. Need to add test data with sample attribute

### What will I do this week?
* Continue to work on mint DOI project
* Work on issue PR 550 - try to fix dataset link preview function
* Work on drop down box problem in PR #521 - can use browserstack tool to help 
  test on all browsers
