# Calibrating complexity meeting - {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}

* It's difficult to provide accurate estimates of the time required to develop functionality due to the uncertainty with the implementation of the user story.
* The functionality associated with user stories can be given a complexity point based on a scale such as the Fibonacci sequence (1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21).
* Today's meeting was used to practice this technique of scoring complexity using merged pull requests.
* Link to calibration of story points spreadsheet - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wBJVaunspso-byaatTZkbLcnK7N617DFgGw5UuTX1eI
* The developers in the tech team now have a shared understanding of what is simple and what is complex in terms of developing functionality in GigaDB.
