# SCRUM meeting minutes for {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}

## Peter

### What did I do last week?
* Started reading Essential SCRUM book
* TPM recruitment
  * Updated [job spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s0j0ZVY6NPz--2Y3xReVzR-F-OP97izJ1MYNP465XWE)
  * Created draft of advert on [JobsDB](https://hk.jobsdb.com/hk) - set to go 
    live on Wed 17 Mar after passing their company checks
    * Cost was $998
  * Created [advert]((https://www.cpjobs.com/hk/job/technical-project-manager-3667055)) 
    on CPJobs
    * Cost was HK$800 and advert will be displayed for 1 month
* Merged pull request fix for [504 gateway timeout error](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/554)
    * Then had to [fix](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/557) CSV 
      files to provide test data as I forgot to rebase against develop branch
    * Then found `build_webapp` stage fails in CI/CD pipeline due to broken 
      Dockerfile in upstream develop branch. Created [fix](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/559)
      by updating package list before package installation in Dockerfile
* WL submission wizard
    * Cleaned up branches in pli888 fork of gigadb-website repo using [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com)
    * Worked on fixing dataset image upload. WL developed new functions for 
      image upload but they are not being currently used.

## What will I do this week?
* Finish preparing TPM advert to be displayed on JobsDB website
* Finish merging Ken's PRs
* Look at Chris's mock up slides for subwiz to see how he wants the dataset 
  image upload functionality to work. Write user stories and develop their tests

### Are there any problems in the way?
* None

## Rija

### What did I do last week?
* Arranging next step for SCRUM GigaDB project management, the product backlog 
  meeting. Received useful replies from everyone. Sent doodle - meeting will be
  on Monday 22 March at 2pm HK time.
* Creating end to end demo video of FUW - almost finished. Assumed CNGB has 
  Alicloud NAS mount and have been using hard-coded URL to FTP server. One way 
  to fix this is to use Docker volume plugin to mount any filesystem using [rexray](https://github.com/rexray/rexray)
  to mount S3 as a docker volume. This is an open source project backed by DELL 
  but has not been developed for 3 years so project is abandoned. Allows 
  mounting any storage provider as a docker volume. Decided not to add this step 
  to end to end demo.

### What will I do this week?
* Schedule meeting for 22nd March
* Finish end to end demo then rebase branch with latest develop code

### Are there any problems in the way?
* None expected.

## Ken

### What did I do last week?
* Mint DOI project
  * Created prototype using [Azure](https://5m1bfb.axshare.com/#id=m363d5&p=main_page)
  * Tried to use REST service processor in Taverna but doesn't work with 
    CrossRef API.
* Worked on PR [550](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/550)
  * Was stuck with how to create mock response - can now use Guzzle mock handler
  * Finished StoreDatasetLinkPreview and will work other preview class
  * configure controller class and use it in view class
* Worked on problem with PR [521](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/521)
  * After rebasing, dropdown citation box looks wrong on different browsers
  * Check page view zoom percentage. Probably not simply cross browser 
    difference problem but need to check with Safari, Chrome and Firefox

### What will I do this week?
* Continue work on PR 550 to pass acceptance tests
* Work on drop box problem in PR 521
* Continue work on Mint DOI project
  * Try using Beanshell script to use CrossRef API
  * Finish work on Azure prototype and send to Nicole
