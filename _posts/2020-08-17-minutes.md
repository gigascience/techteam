## Peter

### What did I do last week?
* Received Python source code for CNGB's Python Django application that is 
  manages FTP users. This relates to [issue 465](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/465)
* Helping Ken with [issue 276](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/276).
  Discovered curators are using a Python script to create the readme files for 
  datasets. Suggested to stop work on this issue and plan what to do next due to
  the Python script.
* Helped Ken with testing his [pagination](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/495/files) 
  work.
* Created [pull request 496](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/496)
  for sending email notifications. Will look into Rija's proposal to implement a 
  component email service for sending messages so that all email sending 
  requirements can use this.
* Worked on WL bugs - mainly user interface fixes to subwiz tabs, empty drop 
  down lists. Also worked on missing sample templates [issue 393](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/393)

### What will I do this week?
* Continue bug fixes to WL submission wizard

* Look into email functionality


### Are there any problems in the way?
