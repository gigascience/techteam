# SCRUM meeting minutes for {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}

## Peter

### What did I do last week?
* Helped Ken with setting up his dev environment on laptop.
* Continued working on porting WL commits from their submission wizard work over to a branch on my gigadb-website fork on my GitLab account.

### What will I do this week?
* WL work continuing this week. I think I have about 20 commits left to copy over. And then there will be bugs that Chris H has identified from the WL work.
* Still working with Ken to now set up his GitLab environment for running CI/CD pipelines.

### Are there any problems in the way?
* Problem in that the subwiz uses the old grey GigaDB website look which is not consistent with the latest green look. Could hack it so that it looks like the latest green website look.
* Problems if authors decide not use it. Then will need to re-implement Jesse's Excel spreadsheet parser?
* Hope to finish porting over WL's work this week or next week.

## Rija

### What did I do last week?
* Start last meeting, working on main piece of file upload wizard. When authors have uploaded all files and editors signed off datasets then curators need to move files to public FTP server. User will press button on web page to do this but this process can take time. Works in 2 stages - move files from their source then when all files are in FTP in server, move metadata into GigaDB. Need to use queue system to not block the web interface by using Beanstalk. Also create PHP controller to handle movement of files to FTP server. Also add method to library to connect file upload wizard REST API to implement domain logic for moving files.

### What will I do this week?
* Doing the other side of system to get job from message queue to get file and move it to FTP server. Using PHP fly system to abstract between different cloud platforms. Finish 2-3 weeks.

### Are there any problems in the way?
* Need to listen to queue to take a job from there: supervisor or systemD.
* Dataset needs a DOI - should ask Chris H.
* Will need to start thinking about integrating the WL submission wizard with the file upload wizard.
