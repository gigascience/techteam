# GigaDB infrastructure meeting minutes for {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}

* Rija went through his [plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nd316oLz90VxOxg73h6iukN_EtUI52iciTBC9AWORP4/edit?usp=sharing) 
  to implement the GigaDB infrastructure
* Plan consists of 4 spreadsheets:
  * Milestones
  * Gantt chart
  * Blockers/Questions
  * Risks
* Gannt chart shows a list of steps. Each step is a high-level description of a 
  piece of work. Each step equates to a user story. Each step will be associated
  with one or more GitHub issues that can be used to discuss the work step item.
  * The steps are grouped into 4 phases.
  * The use of `sprints` to focus work on specific steps to achieve a clear goal
    was discussed.
  * An optimistic guess of the time required to perform all the work is 6 
    months.
* The work required to create this plan takes a lot of effort. The recruitment
  of a Technical Project Manager who could manage this work and other technical
  work that is going on in GigaScience Press was discussed.
