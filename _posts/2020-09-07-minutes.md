# SCRUM meeting minutes for {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}

## Peter

### What did I do last week?
* Worked on [PR 496](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/496) to 
  develop MailService Component class for sending emails. Problem with using
  Yii2 swiftmailer package for sending emails caused by Yii application not
  being able to find swiftmailer classes. This was fixed by Rija.

### What will I do this week?
* Re-start developing Component MailService class for sending emails using
  swiftmailer. Think about how to test mail service - look into using eml files.
* Look at Ken's work on file attribute delete and pagination issues


### Are there any problems in the way?
* None

## Ken

### What did I do last week?
* Worked on issue [#457](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/457), 
  and made a PR [#503](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/503),
  to add a delete Attribute functionality to the adminFile page. I have created 
  the button, and it can be seen properly at the right page.
* Continued learning using [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)

### What will I do this week?
* Clean up code and test for pagination issue and finish PR
* Learning: freecodecamp courses JS, API courses


### Are there any problems in the way?
* I found that every time I ran behat test at my branch, my local gigadb 
  database would be overwritten and I could not log in gigadb as admin. Is it 
  normal? I have to `rm -rf~/.containers-data/gigadb` and 
  `docker-compose run --rm webapp` to restore it.


## AOB

* tech@gigasciencejournal.com - this has been created using Google Groups
  https://groups.google.com/a/gigasciencejournal.com/g/tech and has been 
  configured to be a [collaborative inbox](https://support.google.com/a/answer/167430?hl=en).
* I can add test@gigasciencejournal.com account to tech group and do some 
  testing with email sending and replies to determine how to configure the 
  Google Group
