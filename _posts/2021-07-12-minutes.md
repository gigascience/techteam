# SCRUM meeting minutes for {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}

## Backup plan
* `cngb-gigadb-bak` server has limited access to public internet so might be 
  this reason why it cannot access buckets from our test Tencent account.
* `cngb-gigadb-bak` server will need to `docker pull` from `registry.gitlab.com`
  to install and use the Yii2 backup tool.
* Yii2 backup tool should now use `rclone` as the underlying shell command for interacting with Tencent buckets instead of `coscmd`.

## Deployment problem
* Update to composer might have caused PHP version checking problem.
* See [#708](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/708) for work
  on deployment pipeline which wasn't originally planned during Sprint 1 
  planning.

## Review FTP URL replacement updater tool
* Ready for review now
* Test tool on local computer with production database data before running 
  against production server
