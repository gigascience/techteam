# SCRUM meeting minutes for {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}

## Peter

### What did I do last week?
* Chris A's dataset download - finished last Wed
* Approved [team](http://gigadb.org/site/team) page Ken's [PR #446](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/446) 
* Looked at [issue #291](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/291) new FAQ and dataset checklists for Ken which relates to [PR #449](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/449)
* Started working on [docker image volume problem](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/342) but tests failed on CI/CD pipeline which meant I could not test the fix on staging server. Therefore, started fixing tests which were failing locally
    * Merge [PR #447](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/447) Linkedin affiliate sign in functionality
    * Problem with ORCID tests - think the problem is caused by sandbox ORCID server. Redirect URI works with `gigadb.gigasciencejournal.com:9170` but does not allow `http://gigadb.dev` to be used which is the address of the server used for acceptance tests. So what to do? Change name of testing server or comment out ORCID behat tests for now. Rija suggests commenting the test out or set bash script to not run it


### What will I do this week?
* [PR #449](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/449) for Ken
* Sort out ORCID affiliate sign in using ORCID sandbox
* Check fix for [Docker image problem](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/342)
* Yii migration - look at Faker tool

### Are there any problems in the way?
* None expected

## Rija

### What did I do last week?
* Fixed removing fragilities from upload wizard. Process was causing flow to have latency to wait up to 60 sec before able to see metadata in database. Problem is because user loads data using ftp and ftp does not have hookups to detect changes in filesystem and then update database. Also RACE conditions.
* Started looking at deployment on AWS but need to ensure file upload wizard use abstraction layer so it doesn't care about which cloud provider it uses.
* Looked into deployment process

### What will I do this week?
* Continue deployment to AWS and Alicloud

### Are there any problems in the way?
* None expected.
