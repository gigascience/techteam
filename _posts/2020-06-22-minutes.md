# SCRUM meeting minutes for {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}

## Peter

### What did I do last week?
* Looked at ORCID affiliate sign in functionality since its tests were failing
on a local GigaDB due to the ORCID sign in button at `/site/login` being 
commented out - see [here](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/408). 
The reason for this is that the ORCID affiliate sign in functionality is missing 
the retrieval of the user's email address from the ORCID API which is required 
for registering as a GigaDB user. Merged a [pull request](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/450) for excluding ORCID tests.
* Looked at PR [449](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/449) for 
Ken.
* Read up on [PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/) code standards
* Wrote functional test  for captcha image [problem](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/342) 
* Read up on [Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) tool and considered 
how it can be used for database migration script work.


### What will I do this week?
* Merge PR [452](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/452) display images in local and staging server gigadb
* Yii migration scripts - document steps in getting prod data written up as migration scripts and seeing how this can be automated using Faker tool with PHP Yii application 

### Are there any problems in the way?
* None expected

### What did I do last week?
* Tested deployment of file upload wizard to AWS. Trial and error approach. 
Update Terraform and Ansible scripts. They made changes in syntax so need to 
change terraform script to change how variable are used. Ansible playbook were 
breaking due to syntax errors in scripts. YAMLint is a tool that is useful to 
detect errors
* Updated docker compose file for file upload wizard. 
* Gitlab could not find Centos deployed daemon due to Centos having enabled 
firewalld which does not play well with Docker. Disabled firewall but can 
configure to make it work in the future.

### What will I do this week?
* Deploy on Alicould - then rebase branch with develop branch

### Are there any problems in the way?
* None expected.
