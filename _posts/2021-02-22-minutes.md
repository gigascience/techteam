## Rija

### What did I do last week?
* Worked on creating demo video of workflow for FUW
* Discovered issues with FUW that required fixing
* Found cosmetic bugs in dataset update functionality that needed to be fix
* Problem with CICD pipeline in that it  wipes out database when deploying 
  application to staging server
* Did planning - introduced SCRUM process to team. Responded to feedback from 
  Peter
* Had meeting with Laurie and updated infrastructure risks based on her comments
* Refreshed SCRUM knowledge by reading [Essential Scrum](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Scrum-Practical-Addison-Wesley-Signature-dp-0137043295/dp/0137043295/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) book by K. Rubin
* Updated SCRUM gist with information on
    * how to do daily scrum
    * calibrating complexity - estimate how complex the stories are, need to 
      have scale.
    * explain to the wider team what SCRUM is
* Reviewed [PR](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/554) on 504 
  gateway timeout problem

### What will I do this week?
* Look at TPM job description
* Continue working on creating demo video for FUW
* Continue planning work on GigaDB infrastructure

### Are there any problems in the way?
* None expected.

## Ken

### What did I do last week?
* Mint DOI project
  * Learning how to do beanshell scripting
* Github issues
  * Rebased add delete button issue 457 feature branch with develop branch so 
    that new test data can be added - this PR is ready for review now

### What will I do this week?
* Mint DOI project
  * Look at Dockerfile to make it more lightweight
* Github issues
    * Plan work for passing cached dataset link preview

### Are there any problems in the way?
* None expected.

## GigaDB infrastructure planning

* How to do daily scrum remotely?
  * Options are video conferencing, synchronous chat, asynchronous chat with 
    logging, or something else
  * We are located in different time zones
  * For asynchronous chat, can use tools like: 
    * [Gitter](https://gitter.im)
    * [MS Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software)
    * [Geekbot](https://geekbot.com)
    * [Slack](https://slack.com)
  * Development problems can be discussed with video conference calls
  * ACTION: list options google doc
* How to calibrate complexity so dev team have a shared scale of what's easy and
  what's complex?
  * This issue is related to time of delivery estimates. These are almost always 
    wrong and a more accurate way of estimating development time is required
  * Understanding complexity can be done by looking at past development work 
    which is then used as a scale for new upcoming work
  * [Planning poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) is done after 
    this so developers agree on the amount of work required and this is conveyed 
    to other people in GigaScience
* Explain clearly to wider team how to perform their role in SCRUM
  * Work involves how to be a chicken, grooming of product backlog, planning and
    retrospective
  * Keeping everyone notified of work progress
  * This will be an on-going process
* When to start sprint work on [GigaDB infrastructure](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nd316oLz90VxOxg73h6iukN_EtUI52iciTBC9AWORP4/edit?ts=6017b2aa#gid=1115838130)?
  * Start with `Prepare tooling for storage provider assessment`
  * Set date for complexity calibration for above work - this Thursday 25th 
    February
  * Next week, look at [product backlog](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cXn4f879vfzsflcKXGPghqIM_DAvPQGb)
