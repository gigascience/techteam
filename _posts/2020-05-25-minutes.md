# SCRUM meeting minutes for {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}

## Peter

### What did I do last week?
* Rija's books added to my books on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwkLeOIewSZCQ0RtV2ppcUxOZVk?usp=sharing)
* Helped Ken with work on issues and pull requests
* Finished porting WL submission wizard commits to a branch on my fork of gigadb-website

### What will I do this week?
* Consolidate work done on WL submission wizard and decide next steps:
  * Confirm changes in database schema from WL subwiz work to Chris H and tech team 
  * Get WL's unit and acceptance tests working in PHP framework
  * Look at what WL submission wizard functionality is actually present then align these with Chris H's bugs identified from staging server.
* Ken:
  * Need to look at pull request [#147](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/pull/427) for issue [#160](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/160) 

### Are there any problems in the way?
* Lack of comments and documentation in WL code - use PHP Doc to document WL code.

## Rija

### What did I do last week?
* Developing worker class to pick up job from queue to update dataset metadata in gigadb database.
* Created a sub-application call file worker to update the gigadb database. Uses the Yii application basic template in file worker.

### What will I do this week?
* Still working on file worker - need to develop saving sample metadata in gigadb
* Need to share constants, domain model classes across sub-applications. Using PSR-4 to find common classes. Need to change docker-compose file to add a new directory mount

### Are there any problems in the way?
* Need to strengthen the way the server will be deployed on CI/CD pipeline to allow switching to a hot back up. Put this in the audit document.
* Testing on a production database suggests we need to find out what Chris H wanted to do.
