# SCRUM meeting minutes for {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}

## Peter

### What did I do last week?
* Scrum for Software Developers course
* Reviewed latest emails re: cHGR datasets in GigaDB
    * Query from Hongling re: GigaDB dataset 100891 that was generated by re-using cHGR data described by https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/77/9/2255. CNGB wants us to prove this dataset was re-used to create dataset 100891. Replied by saying could do this by replicating bioinformatics procedure with cHGR data to create a maf file and check if it is similar to the one in dataset 100891.
